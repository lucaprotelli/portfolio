Hello everyone, welcome to my blog!
I’m a 20-year-old Italian student with a deep passion for Human-Computer Interaction and UX design. Currently pursuing a degree in Digital Interfaces and Communication Technologies at the University of Trento, I’ll be using this space to document my journey, share my challenges, and explore my aspirations as I work toward becoming a successful designer.

## How did I end up studying Interfaces and Communication Technologies?

My journey into technology began when I chose to study Computer Science in high school, a decision that turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever made. At first, I struggled, feeling like the field wasn’t the right fit for me, especially because I wasn’t drawn to algorithmic concepts.

Everything changed a year later when COVID hit Italy, and classes shifted online. During that time, we were introduced to web development, guided by a professor who was a perfect fit for me. That moment sparked a passion that set me on a completely new path.

From that point on, I fully immersed myself in web development, determined to learn as much as possible. I started creating websites and, after a year, faced a big decision: which university would shape my future? Initially, I considered pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.

That summer, however, I had the chance to intern at a small startup in Bologna. As a minor in a completely new environment, I used that experience to reflect on my life and future. I worked closely with the two founders, who had dropped out of their Computer Science degrees to build their own startup and follow their passion.

This experience taught me the true meaning of work as a software developer. One of the founders, who was responsible for all the coding, would arrive at the office before me and stay long after I left, spending his entire day coding. I also spent my days coding, and through that intense routine and observing his dedication, I realized that Computer Science might not be the right path for me.

The real challenge for me was realizing that I wanted to work with digital interfaces, not as a developer, but from a designer’s perspective.

One of the key projects I worked on was a dashboard for the founders to manage their users. While building it, I discovered that my focus was naturally drawn to the interface and figuring out the best way to present the data. Looking back, I noticed the same trend in my previous projects: I was always more interested in designing interfaces and solving user problems than in coding complex algorithms or making them more efficient. After a thoughtful discussion with the founders, I came to terms with the fact that Computer Science wasn’t my passion.

The problem was: is there a bachelor’s degree that combines Psychology and Sociology to understand and analyze user behaviors, Digital Design to address those problems and prototype potential solutions, and Computer Science to develop those solutions? At the beginning, I really struggled to find a university that met my needs.

One day in high school, a classmate told me about a program at the University of Trento that offered exactly what I was looking for. That conversation marked the beginning of my journey into this exciting field. From that moment on, I’ve been fascinated by the ways technology interacts with people.

Fast forward to today: I’m studying Interfaces and Communication Technology at the University of Trento, where I’m exploring interface design, and, most importantly, how to find the best solutions by analyzing users’ problems.

## What’s the purpose of this blog?

##### Why would a simple bachelor’s student start one? And what can you possibly learn from a student in HCI?

These might be the questions you’re asking yourself. At university, I’ve heard this quote many times:

> **There’s no such thing as stupid questions… only stupid answers.**

With that in mind, I’ll do my best to answer your questions.

In the future, I’d like to enroll in a master’s program in Europe or the United States. Since admission to these programs is highly competitive, I believe having a personal blog can help me stand out. Here, I’ll share small research projects on topics I’m passionate about in the world of digital interfaces and interaction.

I’ll explore both general topics in interface design and more specific ones, using real-world case studies from existing companies. My main goal is to document my journey as a student and share research I’ve done purely out of curiosity and passion. Every post will be supported by proper research, and I’ll always cite my sources. This way, I’m not just providing standalone insights but offering tools to help readers dive deeper into areas that interest them.

I hope my posts inspire others to explore specific aspects of this vast field. Let’s face it, this world is hard to navigate without the right resources or a clear starting point. That’s why I’ll share things like articles, academic papers, books, videos, podcasts, and even references to key figures in the industry.

This blog is for people like me: curious minds who don’t settle for surface-level answers or the easiest solutions but want to dig deeper and truly understand this field. I also hope it helps other students or aspiring designers who feel lost, overwhelmed by too much information, or unsure how to organize their thoughts and move forward. If reading my blog helps even one person tackle a challenge we all face as students, I’ll feel like I’ve succeeded.

I hope this post inspires you to start your journey too.
