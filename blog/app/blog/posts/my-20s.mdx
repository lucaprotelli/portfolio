Hello everyone!

This post is a reflection on what it feels like to step into your 20s, seen through the eyes of someone who’s just beginning this journey. As a student, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future. Honestly, it’s kind of overwhelming sometimes. I often wonder, “Am I on the right path?” or “Is what I’m doing now going to matter?” It’s tough not to get caught up in the stress and uncertainty that comes with trying to figure out what comes next.

But I do think these years are special in a way. It feels like there’s more room to take risks, experiment, and invest in ourselves. It’s not that we can’t do those things later in life, but right now, we don’t have as many responsibilities weighing us down, and maybe that makes it a bit easier to make mistakes, learn, and grow.

## **Overwhelmed by Choices**

There are moments when I question whether what I’m doing will really have any value. Sometimes, I feel like the world is so full of options, so many paths to choose from, that it’s hard to know which direction to take. I see so much information online—so many topics to explore—that it becomes hard to know where to start or what’s worth my attention. In the beginning, it feels like I make a lot of mistakes, but I guess that’s part of learning, right?

The thing is, I don’t think there’s a “perfect” way to go about it. I’ve realized that it’s easy to rush things, especially when we get advice about following the best sources or the quickest methods. But sometimes, I feel like it’s important to take my time. To let things sink in, ask myself questions, and not be afraid to explore different perspectives.

## **The Role of Curiosity**

One thing I’m starting to understand is that being curious—truly curious—is one of the most valuable things I can practice. Curiosity doesn’t always lead to clear answers, but it keeps me exploring, keeps me learning, and I think that’s what helps ideas come together. It’s not about having everything figured out from the start. It’s about staying open, even when things feel uncertain.

So, I’m trying not to get too stuck on the first bit of information I find. Instead, I’m trying to enjoy the process of discovering, diving deeper, and questioning what I learn along the way.

## **Embracing the Journey**

But here’s something I’ve been thinking about lately: **What if the real challenge is not knowing exactly what’s next, but being okay with that uncertainty?**

I guess the best advice I could give myself right now is to stop overthinking things. Life isn’t a straight line. It’s more like a roller coaster with its ups and downs. Some days I feel lost, some days I feel like I’m making progress, but I think it’s okay to not have everything figured out yet.

In this fast-paced world, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, to feel like we should be doing more or going faster. But sometimes, it helps to pause and reflect on what we’re really doing. It’s scary to put in effort and not know if it’s going to work out. But isn’t that what life is about? Trying things, failing sometimes, and learning from those experiences.

We’re young, and we have time to figure out what we’re passionate about. We don’t have to have it all together right now. Maybe we will fail at times, but that’s normal. The most important thing is to keep going, keep asking questions, and be open to learning and growing.

Remember, life isn’t just about your career or achievements. It’s about finding balance and connecting with yourself. If we can do that, I think we’ll be on the right track.

So, as we’re figuring out what to do with our lives, let’s remember that it’s not about having everything figured out right away. We need time to explore, to make mistakes, and to learn from them.
